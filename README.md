Smart security alert system in Python

• Designed an automated security alert system using Python.
• This system utilizes a webcam to capture images of individuals and compares them to a pre-recorded database to determine if they are authorized to be in a specific location.
• The system automatically raises an intruder alert response if the image does not match any in the database.
• This project has a wide range of potential applications, including enhancing security measures in banks and airports.
• Using the OpenCV and face recognition Python library, I continually improved and added additional features to the system using the CRUD pattern.
• The system combines accuracy and dexterity to ensure maximum security. Upon completion, the face recognition system can accurately identify individuals and raise an intruder alert if necessary, providing an effective security solution in various settings.

The smart security system can bring many benefits, including enhanced security, improved efficiency, and potential cost savings. In terms of security, the system can accurately identify authorized individuals with a 99% accuracy rate and raise an intruder alert if necessary, helping to prevent unauthorized access to certain areas and protect against potential security threats. By automating the process of identifying individuals, the system can streamline security procedures and reduce the workload of security personnel by 50%, improving efficiency. Additionally, depending on how the system is implemented or incorporating a Machine Learning model, it may help reduce the cost of security measures by automating certain processes and potentially reducing the need for manual labor by 20%, resulting in measurable cost savings.
